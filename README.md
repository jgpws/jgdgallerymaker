jgdGalleryMaker is an online website where you can create an HTML/CSS gallery for free.

Currently, you can specify image size, gap size in between each image and padding around the overall gallery. These are all predefined sizes.

In Editing mode, you can move images left or right and select images for deletion.

As this is a new project, more features are on the way. I plan to offer some additional layout styles for the gallery and maybe an option to add captions (image descriptions).

The webpage includes instructions for how to use jgdGalleryMaker.
